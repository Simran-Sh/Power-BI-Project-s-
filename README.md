# Power BI Project(s)

This repository contains my end-to-end **Power BI** projects, created to practice and showcase my skills in data analysis and dashboard development.

As I’m learning Power BI, I’m focusing on:
- Building **data models** (Fact & Dimension tables)
- Writing **DAX measures** and **calculated columns**
- Using **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- Designing **interactive dashboards** with slicers, filters, and visuals
- Creating **KPIs** and performance summaries for business users
